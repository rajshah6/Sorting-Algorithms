# Sorting-Algorithms
This program will sort an array of any size of random numbers between -1000 to 1000 using 4 methods of the user's choice, selection sort, bubble sort, insertion sort, or quick sort. The user can also choose to see the numbers in ascending or descending order.

To use the program, download all the files, open them through a Java IDE, and run the SearchingRoutines.java file located inside the "src" folder.
